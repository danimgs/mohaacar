$terceros="THIRD PARTY INSURANCE";
$texto1="Any car insurance includes a series of minimum coverage. The most important is the 
		liability of the driver. This coverage means that insurance will cover the damage, personal 
		or material, caused to third persons by the policyholder. What is not going to cover are 
		themselves harms the holder driver or their vehicle, suffering from although the occupants 
		of your car that are covered, as are considered 'third'.";
$texto2="The covers are fixed by law and are 15 million euros as maximum in case of damages and 
		70 million in case of physical damage, regardless of how many are the victims of the accident.
		Most third party insurance policies often include other coverages, such as roadside assistance, 
		legal defense and insurance for own driver. Anyway, these coverages will vary depending on the 
		company that contracted the insurance.";
$aviso="* Notice: There is a certain type. Not all third party insurance cover the same thing. 
		Or all-risk insurance have the same conditions. Much depends on what each company considers 
		'essential' in defining a certain 'a third party', 'for all', etc.";
/*tercerosAmpliado*/
$tituloseguros="INSURANCE EXTENDED THIRD";
$foto1="It is more affordable than a fully comprehensive insurance.
  		It includes, in addition to everything that the company deems worthy
   		to compose a third party insurance, in case of fire,
   		theft and broken windows. These are the three most common cases,
   		although as we have said, depending on the insurance company
   		other coverage, such as the replacement vehicle will be included,
   		legal expenses, etc.";
$foto2="For car glass, this type of insurance cover breakage
		windshield, rear window and side windows.
		In some cases also enter the sunroof.
		If there is a fire and the car is a total loss,
		it is usual that during the first two years of life
		the car is returned 100 per 100 of the amount.
		If it is older, the venal or venal improved value will be paid.
		It is the norm, but there are policies that pay the market value
		car from day one. If the fire is partial and
		there have been some damaged parts,
		It will be paid for both these areas.";
$texto3="And the last of the three cases that usually cover these
  		 insurance is theft. We must differentiate between robbery and theft.
  		 The first is considered to have been hard and the second no.
  		 Some policies cover only two assumptions and other thefts.
  		 It is also normal in these cases cover damage
  		 in case of attempted theft.";
$aviso="*Warning: There is no safe type.
		 Not all third-party insurance covering the same.
		 Not all risks insurance have the same conditions.
		 They depend very much on what each company considers 'essential'
		 when defining a safe as 'third parties', 'all risks', etc.";
